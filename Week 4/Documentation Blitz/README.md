# Documentation Blitz

## Summary

This project involved improving the code documentation by adding professional KDoc (Kotlin docstring) to the most confusing and undocumented function: `isValidMeasurement`.

### What Was Done
- Added detailed KDoc to the `isValidMeasurement` function, including parameter descriptions, return value, and a usage example.
- Generated a report (`report.md`) summarizing the documentation improvement.

### Why?
- To enhance code readability, maintainability, and developer onboarding.
