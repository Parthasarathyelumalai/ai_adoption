# Refactor Report: validateInputs Function

## Original Issue
The `validateInputs` function was highly complex, with deeply nested and duplicated phone number validation logic. This made the function hard to read, maintain, and test.

## Improvement Made
- Extracted the phone number validation block into a separate helper function (`validatePhoneNumberField`).
- Added a helper function (`isPhoneNumberField`) to clarify intent and reduce repeated code.

## Measurable Benefit
- Reduced cyclomatic complexity of `validateInputs`.
- Improved readability and maintainability.
- Isolated phone number validation logic for easier testing and future changes.
