# validateInputs.kt

This file contains the new, refactored `validateInputs` function, which performs comprehensive validation on form input data, including checks for mandatory fields, phone numbers, dates of birth, and other custom logic.

## Old vs New Code
- The original (unrefactored) version is preserved in `validateInputs_old.kt`.
- The improved, refactored version is in `validateInputs.kt`.

## Recent Refactor
- The phone number validation logic was extracted into a helper function to improve readability and maintainability.
- The function is now easier to test and extend.

## Usage
- Call `validateInputs()` from the appropriate file to validate the current form data.
- The function returns `true` if all validations pass, otherwise `false`.

## Testing
- Ensure that all edge cases for phone number, date of birth, and other fields are covered in your tests.
- The helper functions can be tested independently for correctness.
