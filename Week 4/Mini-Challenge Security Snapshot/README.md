# Security Fix Summary

## Issue
- Sensitive location data (latitude, longitude) was being stored insecurely, risking user privacy.

## Solution
- Introduced `SecuredPreference` using `EncryptedSharedPreferences` for secure, encrypted storage of sensitive data.
- Updated `SpiceLocationManager` to use this secure storage mechanism.
