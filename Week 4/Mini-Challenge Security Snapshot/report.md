# Security Report: SpiceLocationManager

## Vulnerability Identified
**Insecure Storage of Sensitive Location Data**

- The original implementation stored latitude and longitude using `SecuredPreference`, but there was no evidence that this class used secure storage. If it used plain `SharedPreferences`, this would expose sensitive location data to attackers, especially on rooted or compromised devices.

## Fix Applied
- Implemented `SecuredPreference` using Android's `EncryptedSharedPreferences` to ensure all sensitive data is encrypted at rest.
- Updated `SpiceLocationManager` to initialize `SecuredPreference` with the application context, ensuring secure storage is always used.

## Recommendation
- Always use encrypted storage for sensitive user data, especially location, credentials, or personal identifiers.
- Review all usages of preferences in the codebase to ensure no sensitive data is stored unencrypted.
