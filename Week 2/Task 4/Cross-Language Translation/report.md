# Translation Report: Python to Kotlin

## What Was Done
- A moderately complex Python function (`process_data`) was created to process a list of records, including loops, conditionals, data structures, and error handling.
- The function was translated to Kotlin (`processData`), maintaining the same business logic and adapting to idiomatic Kotlin patterns and naming conventions.

## Translation Process
1. **Function Structure:**
   - Python's `def` was mapped to Kotlin's `fun`.
   - The function name was converted to camelCase as per Kotlin conventions.
2. **Data Structures:**
   - Python's `list of dict` was mapped to Kotlin's `List<Map<String, Any>>`.
   - Python's result `dict` became a `mutableMapOf` in Kotlin.
3. **Loops and Conditionals:**
   - The `for` loop and `if` statements were directly translated.
   - `continue` statements work similarly in both languages.
4. **Error Handling:**
   - Python's `try/except` was mapped to Kotlin's `try/catch`.
   - Exception types were adapted to Kotlin's standard exceptions.
5. **Type Handling:**
   - Kotlin requires explicit type casting and null safety checks, handled with smart casts and the Elvis operator.
6. **Printing/Logging:**
   - Python's `print` was replaced with Kotlin's `println`.

## Key Differences & Considerations
- **Type Safety:** Kotlin is statically typed, so explicit casting and null checks are necessary.
- **Naming Conventions:** Kotlin uses camelCase for function names and variables.
- **Idiomatic Patterns:** Used Kotlin's collection and exception handling idioms.

## Conclusion
The translation preserves the original business logic while adapting to the idioms and requirements of Kotlin. This example can serve as a template for similar cross-language translation tasks.
