# Cross-Language Translation Example

## Objective
This project demonstrates how to convert a moderately complex data processing function from Python to Kotlin, maintaining business logic and using idiomatic patterns in each language.

## Structure
- `process_data.py`: Contains the original Python function for processing data.
- `ProcessData.kt`: Contains the Kotlin translation of the Python function.
- `report.md`: Documents the translation process and key considerations.

## Usage
1. Review `process_data.py` for the Python implementation.
2. Review `ProcessData.kt` for the Kotlin implementation.
3. See `report.md` for details on translation decisions and patterns used.
